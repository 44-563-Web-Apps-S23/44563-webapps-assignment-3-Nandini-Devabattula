    <p> The Blue Damselfish is a hardy, inexpensive tropical species of damselfish — an excellent choice for beginner fish enthusiasts and advanced marine aquarists alike.
        On the downside, damselfish, especially large males, have a reputation for aggressive behavior. In particular, damselfish will regularly pick on a peaceful tank mate in their space, such as a blenny, goby, firefish, or cardinalfish.</p>
